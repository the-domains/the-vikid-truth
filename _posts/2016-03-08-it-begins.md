# It begins!

I'm finally on the web with thegrid!.. and I have been reincarnated as

> the ViKid Truth. 

A superhero of sorts, still in black and white, as my powers generate and slowly grow. 

I shall interested in rescuing the dazed and confused, especially in the areas of Computers, Music, Math, Science and everything in between. 

In the last phew(!) years I have found myself investigating the metaphysics of Math and its intersection with Quantum Mechanics.  I've been trying to understand the true nature of mathematical space and the superposition of objects. 

I have also been experimenting in understanding Computing at a fundamental level. I hope to develop a short book on this.

Furthermore there have been various experiments that I have taken in altered consciousness.

I want to share my ideas with the world but I am not really sure how, so please be patient as my super powers form and eventually grow. 

Thanks and I hope to see you soon.
